** 2.0.x

/the 2.x.x version is a complete rewrite/

*** 2.1.0

  - initial webui.
    The webui asks the server every second for new leases
    and shows the leases in a tabluar view.
    The webui is only enabled in the Windows build, if you are
    under Linux, and you would use the webui, add the ~-webui~
    option to *lsleasesd* parameters. Check the [[lsleasesd.org][lsleasesd manual]]
    for more information.


  - API change: 'sniffer.NewSniffer' doesn't accept
    a logger instance anymore.

      You can configure the Logger in your app per:
        'plog.GlobalLogger().Add(plog.NewDefaultConsoleLogger())'

      and then create the sniffer instance without the 'plog.Logger' argument:
        'sniffer.NewSniffer(config.NewDefaultConfig())'

*** 2.0.0

  - split client and server in two separate programms
    ('lslease' / 'lsleasesd')
