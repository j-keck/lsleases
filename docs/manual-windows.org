#+TITLE: lsleases Manual

* Intro

*lsleases* helps you to find dynamic assigned ip addresses
from any devices in your local network.

I provide two packages for windows:

  - installable service

  - standalone zip archive


* Installable service

This package installs a service which captures 'DHCP request' broadcast datagrams.

To list captured leases, go to 'Start / Programms / lsleases / list-leases'.


* Standalone zip archive

This package contains a version of lsleases which does not run in
the background and doesn not cache captured leases.

After unpacking execute 'capture-leases.bat'. This starts the leases
sniffer, and displays all captured leases.

Note:
  You need to permit *lsleases* network access so it can capture 'DHCP request' datagrams.
